      <TASK DESCRIPTION>
      # Problem
      I need you to sort a DataFrame by the column 'Col3' in ascending order.

      I have the following DataFrame:
          Col1  Col2  Col3  Type
      0      1     2     3     1
      1      4     5     6     1
      2      7     8     1     2
      3    10    11    12     2
      4    13    14    4     3
      5    16    17    2     3

      I need you to return the sorted DataFrame.
          Col1  Col2  Col3  Type
      2      7     8     1     2
      5    16    17    2     3
      0      1     2     3     1
      4    13    14    4     3
      1      4     5     6     1
      3    10    11    12     2

      # Solution
      The following is the solution code to the problem statement provided above.
      You must complete the code by filling in the missing parts between `### SOLUTION START` and `### SOLUTION END`.
      You must keep any code outside of `### SOLUTION START` and `### SOLUTION END` untouched.
      Once you have completed the code, run it to check if your solution is correct.
      Make sure you keep `### SOLUTION START` and `### SOLUTION END` along with your solution code.

      ```python
      import pandas as pd

      df = pd.DataFrame({
          'Col1': [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16],
          'Col2': [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17],
          'Col3': [3, 6, 1, 12, 4, 2],
          'Type': [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
      })

      ### SOLUTION START
      result = ... # Your code here
      ### SOLUTION END
